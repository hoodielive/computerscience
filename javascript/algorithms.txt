Algorithms 

Time Complexity -> what makes an algorithm fast? 
How many primitive operations are executed? 
    
Time - how long does it take to complete as the input grows. 
..with respect to input size. 
..and assuming worst case scenarios. 

Space Complexity - how much memory is used? 

Problem: Search Query 
Kayak.com - Given a list of hotels, return the price range of hotels in a given search result. 

How would you solve this? 
- We'd expect that the more data we have, the longer it will take to figure out the min and max required for the range. 
- As our dataset grows, the cost can grow really slow or fast.
