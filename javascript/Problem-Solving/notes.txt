Objectives 
  - Define What an Algorithm is 
  - Devise a plan to solve algorithms
  - Compare and contrast problem solving patterns including frequency counters, two pointer problems and divide and conquer

What is an algorithm? 
  + A process or set of steps to accomplish a certain task. 
  + Almost everything that you do in programming involves some kind of algorithm.
  + Its the foundation for being a successful problem solving and developer. 

How do you improve?
  + Devise a plan for solving problems. 
  + Master common problem solving patterns. 

Strategies
  + Understand the problem.
  + Explore concrete examples.
  + Break it Down.
  + Solve/Simplify.
  + Look Back and Refactor. 

Understand the Problem
  + Can I restate the problem in my own words? 
  + What are the inputs that go into the problem? 
  + What are the outputs that should come from the solution to the problem? (return)
  + Can the outputs be determined from the inputs? In other words, do I have enough information to solve the problem?
    You may not be able to answer this question until you set about solving the problem. That's okay; its still worth 
    considering the question at this early stage.
  + How should I label the important pieces of data that are part of the problem?

Write a function which takes two numbers and returns their sum.
