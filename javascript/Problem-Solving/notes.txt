Objectives 
  - Define What an Algorithm is 
  - Devise a plan to solve algorithms
  - Compare and contrast problem solving patterns including frequency counters, two pointer problems and divide and conquer

What is an algorithm? 
  + A process or set of steps to accomplish a certain task. 
  + Almost everything that you do in programming involves some kind of algorithm.
  + Its the foundation for being a successful problem solving and developer. 

How do you improve?

  + Master common problem solving patterns. 

Strategies
  + Understand the problem.
  + Explore concrete examples.
  + Break it Down.
  + Solve/Simplify.
  + Look Back and Refactor.
